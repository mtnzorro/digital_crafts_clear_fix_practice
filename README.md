##CLEAR-FIX practice    

###Instructions from the practice assignment:

Below are two identical rows of boxes:

```
<div class="row">
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

Each box was made to float to the left, and we want each row to have a black background. However, we have a problem, because the black background isn't being applied to either of the two rows. This is the collapsing-parent problem with floats. You need to apply a "clear fix" in order to fix the problem. Apply the styling or modify the markup as needed to make the two divs with a class of "row" take on a black background.


The clear-fix.html file incorporates a clear fix "hack" to work around the collapsing-parent problem, and display the black background.
